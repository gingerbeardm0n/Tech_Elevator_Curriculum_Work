            <p>Don't worry if you can't give great answers to all or even most of these. Aim for being able to
                successfully answer around 70% or less of the questions asked of you.</p>

            <p>Focus on conveying a good impression as someone responsible, competent, and able to learn and grow.</p>
            <p>Remember that people are looking for someone who is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Professional, Responsible, and Reliable</li>
                <li>Knows how to program enough to work without <em>constant</em> help (regular check-ins are normal and
                    expected)</li>
                <li>Able and willing to continue to learn and grow</li>

                        on its own. Abstract classes are allowed to declare abstract members which must be overridden by
                        inheriting classes.</div>

                    <div class="answer">A static method is a method that is associated with the class itself instead of
                        with a specific instance of that class. Because of this, static methods do not have access to
                        instance-specific state, but can be invoked without an instance being created.</div>

                    <div class="answer">Encapsulation is the act of wrapping together related things in a way that hides the internal implementation details and can be easily consumable by outside callers. For example, a BankAccount class protecting the internal balance but providing methods and properties for safe interaction.</div>

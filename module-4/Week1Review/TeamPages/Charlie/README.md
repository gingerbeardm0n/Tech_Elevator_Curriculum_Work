# Week 9 Review Exercise: Instructor Tribute Page

## Context

I want you to create a tribute page to my favorite .NET instructor: John Fulton.

This is a creative loosely-guided exercise designed to get you building and styling a web page using HTML & CSS

I encourage you to have fun with this, but not go overboard on any one area at the expense of any other

## Phase 1: Content

For phase 1, **do not worry about styling or arrangement!**. This is just HTML markup only.

1. Create a HTML File
2. Your HTML file should contain a body with these children:
  - Header
  - Main
  - Aside
  - Footer
3. Your header should have a site title and at least one link to other URLs (these pages do not need to exist and can be whatever you want)
4. The main area should have several headings, at least one image (several are provided in this project), and several paragraphs
5. Your sidebar should have a form with several inputs and a submit button in it (ideas: contact John, guess the number of students John has taught, submit a John quote, etc.). Your form does not need to do anything.
6. The footer should have some form of a copyright or disclaimer printed on it

Bonus: Use time remaining to add additional content, quotes, facts, etc. as needed.

## Phase 2: Mobile layout

1. Link your HTML file to a new CSS file
2. Use CSS Grid and `grid-template-columns` to arrange regions of content how you'd like them to be displayed.
3. Use `color`, `background-color`, and `border-color` in your CSS file to stylize your content.
4. Use Flexbox and traditional margin and padding to arrange things inside of your regions

Bonus: Use `:hover` styling for links

## Phase 3: Desktop layouts

1. Use Chrome's Dev Tools and `@media` queries to handle changes in screen resolution between mobile S and laptop L
2. Perform additional styling and formatting as needed with any time remaining

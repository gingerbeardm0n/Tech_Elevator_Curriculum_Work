      <p>Focus on conveying a good impression as someone responsible, competent, and able to learn and grow.</p>
      <p>Remember that people are looking for someone who is:</p>

        <li>
          <em>Professional</em>,
          <em>Responsible</em>, and

        </li>
        <li>
          Knows how to program enough to work without
          <em>constant</em> help (regular check-ins are normal and

        Welcome to Sally the Squirrel's One-Stop Interview Question Shop!

        This site was created as a way of teaching a bunch of future programmers from Tech Elevator how to develop applications 
        in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Vue.js. 
        
        These folks are pretty awesome, and the subject matter of this site also gives them a way of polishing up on technical interview
        questions related to C#, SQL, and web technologies.
